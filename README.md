# .expec

An experimental language for readable software specifications.

This task defines the ANTLR grammar and a source reader. The tests accept valid syntax, reject malformed source, and preserve authored structure and source locations. Semantic validation and project generation are subsequent work.

## Development

Use Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.20.0.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run dev
```

`check` generates the parser, checks types, runs unit and BDD acceptance tests, and builds the package. `dev` generates the parser once and starts Vitest's watch mode. After editing `src/grammar/Expec.g4`, run `npm run grammar:generate` to regenerate the TypeScript parser; Vitest watches the generated code. Tests use Vitest's `describe`/`it` API; fixtures live in `test/resources`.

## Package

```sh
npm run build
npm run release
```

`release` runs `npm pack`. GitHub Actions builds a package for each task PR merged into the default branch, attaches it to a GitHub Release, and records its deployment. Report incidents through GitHub Issues. npm registry publication is not configured.

Planning, language specifications and project documentation live in [Notion](https://app.notion.com/p/3e603914566581b2a671cbe2927bab48).
